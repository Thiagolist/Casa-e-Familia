      <p>Good morning, sister,</p>
      <p>How are the children? I have an immense desire to be close to those masterpieces of God’s will. I am sure Jesus has cared for you and strengthened you to teach your children with much love.</p>
      <p>The teaching of ethics can explain the need for science, but science is not sufficient to explain the need for ethics. Fundamentally, for a statistician to be truly good, they must be ethical; otherwise their bias can directly influence the results.</p>
      <p>There is something greater than knowledge to be taught to the children, and that is the story and the teachings of Christ.</p>
      <p>May God preserve you all in His grace.</p>
